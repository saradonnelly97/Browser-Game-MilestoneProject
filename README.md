# PRESENTING Heavy Lead Graphite Wars: a click-based browser game

Heavy Lead Graphite Wars is a click-based racing browser game. The player must click their pencil to reach the finish line before the magic cpu pencil beats them to it! Or worse! The timer will run out while the user is trying to nurse their cramping fingers! The user must try their darndest to find the 'sweet-spot' that will keep their lead from breaking; are you perhaps clicking too fast? Who can say...


## Key Features: 

**Clicking Speed:** I wanted the game to be able to track how quickly a user was clicking the in-game asset. The speed of the click would determine whether the asset extended, to reach the finish line, or if clicked too fast would cause the asset to reset to 0.

**Compete Against CPU:** Providing a competitive element by allowing players to race against their computer opponent, wooden pencil. The objective is to find the click 'sweet-spot' while outclicking the CPU, without breaking the extending asset to reach the finish line before the CPU does. 

**Compete Against Time:** Providing a competitive element by allowing players to race against the clock. The objective is to find the click 'sweet-spot' to reach the finish line before the clock runs out. 

*In the future, I would like to include the following:*
*Level-based Challenges: Create a progression system with multiple levels or stages. The objective could be to complete each level within a certain time limit or by reaching a specific score threshold. As the level increases, the click speed will become randomized, causing the user to have to actively experiment with how fast they can click without breaking the extending asset while the CPU progressively increases speed/accuracy as the levels go up.*
