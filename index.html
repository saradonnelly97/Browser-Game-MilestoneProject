        Once upon a time, there was an artist who was tired of their mechanical pencil breaking every time they needed to take notes. As they were cursing their graphite for breaking, a little wizard man appeared -poof- in front of them. <b>I say!</b> roared the wizard-man. <b>If you really want a pencil whose graphite never tires, see if you're powerful enough to wield one first!</b>
        <p>Defeat the magic pencil by reaching the finish line first. Click as quickly as you can, but beware! Click too fast and your graphite might break!</p>
